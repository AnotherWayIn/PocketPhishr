# PocketPhishr
An evil WiFi Access Point for your pocket

Code is based on the original here: https://github.com/adamff1/ESP8266-Captive-Portal and modified to work on a ESP8266 NodeMCU with an oled display - like this: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004513260449.html

Much like the original code, you can browse to the web server on http://172.0.0.1/creds to view all the saved credentials or to http://172.0.0.1/ssid to change the ssid.

This is less painful to visit from a computer rather than a mobile - due to the cpative portal redirect
