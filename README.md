An evil WiFi Access Point for your pocket - because

Code is based on the original here: https://github.com/adamff1/ESP8266-Captive-Portal, with a few changes to work with a display such as this: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004513260449.html

Much like the original code, you can browse to the web server on http://172.0.0.1/creds to view all the saved credentials or to http://172.0.0.1/ssid to change the ssid.


If you want to take it further, there is a case you can 3d print for it here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6099890
